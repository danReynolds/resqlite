# Journal

A researcher's notebook of durable insights from Resqlite performance work.
Each entry is a lesson that earned its place by surviving more than one
experiment — write here only when you have learned something a future runner
shouldn't have to rediscover.

This file sits between two others:

- [`signals.json`](signals.json) — the structured, machine-readable research
  map (per-direction state, statuses, dependencies).
- [`MILESTONES.md`](MILESTONES.md) — the curated, blog-style narrative of how
  the project has evolved, updated on request rather than per experiment.

Journal entries cite the experiments they came from and end with a *Reapplies*
note describing when the lesson kicks in.

## Insights

### An optimization that measures flat may simply not be running

[Exp 099](099-fnv-8byte-bytestream.md) added an 8-byte FNV main loop — a
structurally sound win for long-text streams — and measured nothing. The cause
wasn't the implementation; the streaming benchmarks at the time only carried
≤ 8-byte cells, so the new main loop never executed. Before declaring an
optimization dead, verify the workload actually exercises its hot path.
[Exp 110](110-long-text-stream-benchmark.md) later built the long-cell workload
that exp 099 should have been measured against.

*Reapplies whenever a structurally plausible change shows a flat result. The
hypothesis to test first is "is the path running?", not "is the change wrong?".*

### Reader-pool throughput is round-trip-bound, not parallelism-bound

[Exp 105](105-reader-pool-sizing.md) raised the reader pool cap above
`clamp(numProcessors - 1, 2, 4)` and regressed A11c writer throughput. Per-write
wall closely matches `pool_round_trip × ⌈N/pool_size⌉ + ~30 µs`, so adding
workers only helps when there are enough concurrent reads to saturate them. On
writer-shaped fan-out the extra workers cost more in scheduling than they save
in latency.

*Reapplies when considering "more workers" as a remedy for fan-out latency.
Check the round-trip count first; parallelism without queue pressure is
overhead.*

### Re-running a rejected experiment requires the rejection's reason to have changed

A new workload, signal, or external change can revive a rejected idea — but the
rerun must articulate *what is different* from the original rejection.
[Exp 104](104-094-reeval-under-a11c.md) re-evaluated [exp 094](094-dirty-read-string-reuse.md)
under A11c-shaped fan-out and the maximum effect was still within MDE. Pure
replication of a bounded measurement rarely earns a slot.

*Reapplies whenever an old direction looks tempting again. The working note
should name the specific thing that changed — a new benchmark, a new compiler
release, a related accepted experiment that altered the hot path — not just
"worth another look."*

### Sub-MDE memory deltas can still be real

The benchmark harness measures RSS, but the Dart VM retains heap pages after
GC. A memory win below the per-benchmark MDE can be real — invisible because
the VM didn't return pages to the OS, not because the allocation didn't go
away.

*Reapplies whenever a change targets allocation or object reuse. Prefer
profiler/heap evidence over RSS-only claims; a flat RSS number is not a "no
change" signal.*

### Measurement is a first-class outcome

Three of the most useful experiments in the recent map ([exp 097](097-one-pass-initial-stream-hash.md),
[exp 099](099-fnv-8byte-bytestream.md)'s rejection, [exp 110](110-long-text-stream-benchmark.md))
were either pure measurement work or surfaced their main value by exposing a
gap in the existing benchmarks. When the bottleneck signal is missing, build
the signal — don't force an implementation experiment against a workload that
can't see it.

*Reapplies before any implementation experiment. If you cannot describe the
benchmark line that will move under the change, the next experiment is probably
the benchmark, not the change.*

## How to add to this file

Add an entry when an experiment surfaces a transferable lesson — something a
future runner could reapply to a different direction, or could waste time
relearning. Each entry should:

- Lead with the lesson, not the experiment
- Cite the experiment(s) where it was learned
- End with a *Reapplies* note describing when the lesson kicks in
- Be short enough that the next reader actually reads it

Don't add entries for facts already captured in `signals.json` (that file
covers per-direction state, not transferable lessons). Don't add process
guidance (that lives in `RUNNER_INSTRUCTIONS.md`). Don't add narrative
milestones (those live in `MILESTONES.md`).
